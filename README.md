# MoodAssistant
A mood-adaptive study assistant that uses my webcam, OpenAI API and a Tapo smart bulb to detect whether I'm focused, happy, sad or stressed. It automatically adjusts lighting and audio using custom mood logic to reduce decision fatigue and strengthen state-dependent learning during revision.
